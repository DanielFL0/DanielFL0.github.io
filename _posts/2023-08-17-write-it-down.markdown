When I first started out as a software engineer, I got some fantastic advice from one of the senior developers at the company. It was simple but turned out to be one of the best habits I've developed. The advice? "Write down everything you do."

At first glance, it might seem like a small thingâ€”just writing down notes in a notebook, saving them in a computer file, or even sharing them on a personal blog. But let me tell you, its impact goes way beyond its simplicity.

This advice has had a profound impact on my professional life in two key ways. First off, it acts like a point of reference. When my memory fails me and I'm scratching my head trying to remember what I did earlier, I can turn to my notes and rediscover the thought processes and "aha!" moments that led me to where I am, and the second one, it helped me become more disciplined when writing documentation for the features/projects I work on.

So this is the main reason for this blog, to write about stuff I'm working on and how I solve the problems that come along.
